# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow

This repository is my hands-on practice with the concepts covered in the popular book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron.

**What to Expect:**

- **Chapter-wise Organization:** The repository is meticulously structured with subdirectories mirroring the chapters in the book. This makes it easy to navigate and find the code examples for specific topics.
- **Assignments and Exercises:** Where applicable, the chapter folders will contain subfolders dedicated to the assignments and exercises included in the book. This allows you to follow along, test your understanding, and solidify your learning through practical implementation.
- **Collaborative Learning:** Feel free to contribute your solutions and engage in discussions related to the assignments. This fosters a collaborative learning environment where everyone can benefit from shared knowledge and insights.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone https://<your-github-username>@github.com/<your-username>/Hands-On_MachineLearning_with_Scikit-Learn_Keras_n_Tensorflow.git` to download the codebase.
2. **Set Up Your Environment:** Ensure you have Python (preferably 3.x), Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, and any other necessary libraries installed. Refer to the book's instructions or use package managers like `pip` for installation.
3. **Explore and Experiment:** Feel free to explore the code examples, modify them for your own learning purposes, and attempt the assignments.
4. **Contribute:** If you'd like to share your solutions or create pull requests with improvements, feel free to do so. This helps build a valuable resource for the community.

**Community and Support:**

- For discussions and questions related to the code or the book's content, consider creating issues in this repository.
- Engage with online forums and communities dedicated to machine learning, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. Many helpful resources are available online.

**Additional Notes:**

- This repository is primarily intended for practice and learning purposes.
- It's recommended to work alongside the book for a comprehensive understanding of the concepts.
- Feel free to adapt the code examples to your specific data and problems.

**Let's embark on this hands-on machine learning journey together!**
